## Outstanding Issues

1. **3D Performance on Low-End Devices**: The globe visualization may be demanding for older or low-end devices. Consider adding a "performance mode" with simplified graphics.

2. **Globe Loading Speed**: Initial globe texture loading may take a moment. Consider adding a loading indicator during initialization.

3. **Song Playback**: Currently uses simulated playback. In the production version with Spotify API, real audio playback needs to be implemented.

## Conclusion

The Song Popularity Globe Visualization Web App meets all the requirements and closely matches the reference images in both styling and functionality. The core features work as expected, with the heatmap correctly displaying song popularity data across the globe.

The UI has been enhanced to provide a better user experience with clear feedback on interactions, helpful tooltips, and smooth animations. The design is visually consistent with the reference images, using the same color scheme and overall aesthetic.

The app is ready for user testing and subsequent integration with the Spotify API for real music data.
